                  <h4>Thesis Topic: Integrating Linguistic Features to Improve Machine Translation</h4> <a href="#thesis">Read In Details</a>
                  <p>In my undergraduate thesis titled "A Method for Eliminating Language Differences Between English and French Language", I pioneered a novel approach to enhance machine translation by integrating linguistic features at the core of transformer-based neural architectures.</p>
                  <p>Recognizing the limitations of existing systems in capturing the nuances of the morphologically rich French language, I systematically investigated the impact of incorporating part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and lemmatization into the translation pipeline.</p>
                  <p>Through rigorous experimentation and iterative refinement, I demonstrated the synergistic effects of combining these linguistic features, resulting in significant improvements in translation quality as measured by the industry-standard BLEU metric.</p>
                  <p>My research not only advanced the state-of-the-art in French-English machine translation but also established a robust methodological foundation for leveraging linguistic insights to enhance translation capabilities for diverse language pairs, including low-resource languages.</p>
                  <p>The novel integration of linguistic features within the transformer architecture showcased my deep understanding of computational linguistics principles and cutting-edge neural network architectures.</p>
                  <p>With a keen eye for future research directions, I identified opportunities for developing language-specific evaluation metrics, improving contextual comprehension, and exploring practical applications in cross-cultural communication and knowledge dissemination.</p>

          <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skiier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technolgy advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>

          <h3>A Method for Eliminating Language Differences Between English and French Language | <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jzcx6MoNAuUxA2AHUs7952tN5RmqJe2E/view?usp=sharing">PDF</a> | <a href="https://github.com/sajeeb007/LinguisticFeature">Github</a></h3>
          <h5>Abstract</h5>
          <p> This dissertation investigates approaches to improve the quality of French-to-English
            machine translation through the use of linguistic features including lemma, part-of-speech
            (POS) identifiers, and named entity recognition (NER). In contrast to conventional
            evaluative methodologies, the objective of this study is to enhance the precision and
            consistency of translations by judiciously incorporating linguistic insights. 
            <br><br>The effectiveness of linguistic feature integration in improving the performance of machine translation is
            examined, making use of the vast Common Corpus dataset. The study aims to investigate
            the distinct contributions of linguistic features in enhancing the quality of translations for
            the French and English languages, the importance of incorporating language characteristics
            into machine translation frameworks, methodological structures for integrating linguistic
            characteristics, and observable improvements in translation quality resulting from the
            integration of linguistic features. 
            <br><br>This study makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing
            discussion on improving machine translation in multilingual environments by judiciously
            incorporating linguistic features. It provides significant insights into the ways in which
            linguistic enhancements can bolster the precision and consistency of translations, which
            have far-reaching implications for the fields of computational linguistics, natural language
            processing, and cross-cultural communication.
